Backend Documentation:      
============================
At the location of each of these programs should be a "testdb.txt" file. This file should contain a path to the SQLite Database. 
A sample testdb.txt file has been included. 

All programs have a exit code of 0 on success and not zero if some error occurs. 

Database Structure: 

url Table has the following fields:
    -id
    -url
    -category
    -imagepath
    -views
    -votes
    -comments

 visitor table has following fields:
    -id
    -ip
  
stats table has following fields:
    -id
    -snapcount 

    
Communicating with Server Daemon
================================
Server program should be ran in full X11 environment. It will not work properly when ran over SSH. 

There is a server daemon process running on vienna.clics.cs.columbia.edu on Port 7777. 
Once connected, send a list of URLs to be snapped/captured. These should be full and VALID urls. 
The format in which the URLs should be sent should be as follows: 
    category, vote, URL
    Note: vote is either 1 or 0. 1 means Vote up this URL by that many points. 
    For example: my-fake-cat,1,http://msn.com
   
Once done, send the word "quit" to start the capture process on the server daemon. 
The server will update the Database accordingly. 
From testing, it takes 5 seconds to capture a given URL. 
The images will be stored in the /snaps folder and the name of the image is the SHA1 hash of the url. 

Return Format:
==============
Program that return info on multiple URLs this delimeter "==========" on a new Line. See sample below:
id : 6
url : www.hahahaha.com
category : no-category
imagepath : my-fake-path
views : 0
votes : 1
==========
id : 5
url : www.yahoo.com
category : test0
imagepath : image-test-path0
views : 2
